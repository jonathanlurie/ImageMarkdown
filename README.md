# ImageMarkdown
Helper for publishing images using Markdown plugin for Wordpress

# What is it?

This code takes a list of image url and build a Markdown compliant list of them, with embeded link to themselves.

This intents to facilitate the image integration when using a Markdown plugin in Wordpress. As long as the images are already uploaded to your server.

Requirements:
- The pictures must all be in the same folder (on the web)
- They must be named in a contiguous sequence from M to N (where N is bigger than M)
- They can have a prefix, like DSC_ if they all have the same
- You must specify the extention, like .jpg

# Plateform

This is supposed to be crossed plateform, at least for the main.py file.
However, the file ImageMarkdown.sh will work only on OSX and Linux, but since it is just a double-click shortcut to launch python *main.py*, it will not miss so much to Windows users.

# Launch it

On OSX or Linux, just double click on *ImageMarkdown.sh*, then follow the instructions.
On Windows, launch *python main.py*


# Exemple

Here is a list of images you just uploaded to you server, it was done on January 2015:
