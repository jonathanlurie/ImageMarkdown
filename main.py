What is it?

This code takes a list of image url and build a Markdown compliant
list of them, with embeded link to themselves.

This intents to facilitate the image ntegration when using a Markdown
plugin in Wordpress.

Requirements:
- The pictures must all be in the same folder (on the web)
- They must be named in a contiguous sequence from M to N (where N is bigger than M)
- They can have a prefix, like DSC_ if they all have the same
- You must specify the extention, like .jpg

Here is a list of file:

http://myurl.com/myHolydays_1.jpg
http://myurl.com/myHolydays_2.jpg
http://myurl.com/myHolydays_3.jpg
-> This works
